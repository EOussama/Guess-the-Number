# Guess the Number
---

## Description
Boredom can be a jerk sometimes, nothing major, but here's a snake caliber game for ya, nothing to blow your mind really, very simplistic and somewhat plain? it could stand for a sample project more so than it is viewed as a full production game, but hey, it won't hurt to try, right?

## Usage
You simply have to press the start button in order to start the game, then a secret random number will be generated, all you have to do, is try to guess what it is before the time runs out, when that happens, the secret number is regenerated, and the time is started again (depends on your settings).
There are few settings to go through, of course, customize your gameplay if you can call that one, to begin with, have fun!
